>Insert a picture of all devices with the screens showing different pages, then delete all this gaff in the box.

This is a basic 3 page website for a jiu jitsu academy, displaying it's outline, classes and contact details. It features; 
a jumbotron; scrolling, enlarging and fading pictures; data entry overlays; and icons with links to outside sources.

This website was created as my first milestone project (after study of HTML5 and CSS3) while completing a diploma in 
fullstack development. For the purpose of showcasing HTML and CSS abilities a website is the best media.  Over time, more 
pages and parts can be added to present new skills learned.

The mockup was created in <a href="(https://www.figma.com/file/RZ6ACWWZjSS0PmnffgtA9j/Elemental-Academy?node-id=1%3A12)
">Figma</a> with prototyping.

It is hosted on <a href="(https://github.com/CheriGore)">GitHub Pages</a> and the repository is on <a href="
(https://github.com/CheriGore/MS1-project)">GitHub</a>.

## UX
### USERS

refered to the site or local people interested in joining the academy. Other users may be current students checking the

* For testers with varying skills that can advise of UX and personal preferences

### DESIGN

* The third page (contact) will list the location, academy details and all the parties involved with their contact details

## Testing
>In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the 
>site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure 
>that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their 
>goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, 
link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is 
via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you 
haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<br>

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages 
or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, 
if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
